1. For the S box $ S_0 $:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 3 & 2 \\
3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 1 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 3 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

One can perform a differential cryptanalysis attack by considering the change in differential output $ y'$ as the differential input $x'$ changes. Firstly, we must compute our possible input values and pairs. We have a 4x4 S box, which means the number of input values is $4 \times 4 = 16$, and the number of possible input pairs is $ 16^2 = 256 $. Additionally, the S box output space is only 2 bits, so as the input varies over 16 values, the output values vary over 4 values. With this information we can construct the following differential distribution table:
